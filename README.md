# sops-695

Discussed in https://github.com/mozilla/sops/issues/695

```
diff bad/fooobar.yaml good/fooobar.yaml 
6d5
<     ##
```

`good` is not so good, because my very first comment lines are gone.

# filelist

* `bad`: The original yaml file, and its output generated by sops. The output is a broken yaml file
* `good`: The orignal yaml file, and its output generated by sops. The output is fine, can be decrypted by sops.
  However, some very first comment lines are gone.
